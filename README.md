# SarveshMD.GitHub.io
My first Web application which displays Nasa APOD (Astronomy Picture Of the Day) by connecting to Nasa API. 
I created this project with the hope that I will be able to learn some stuff about JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I did the whole thing without any JS framework so it kind of looks clumsy and bad and it stops working frequently. I am planning to spend some time on learning React, Vue.js or Svelte to update this project and make it look neat and work properly.
